This study investigates a food-poisoning outbreak in Bolnisi region. Study features 84 children who are part of different groups in different kindergartens. Children in age group 2-6 years where affected, the most typical age is 4 years old. The cases are not spread out equally, together Kindergartens ‘K’ and ‘R’ have more than half of entire group of children. Out of 84 children only 2% of cases were hospitalized.

We sent a group of investigators to the outbreak site to acquire more information. They used simple questionnaire to collect this information from the parents. We asked set of standard questions such as their age, kindergarten they attended, the onset of symptoms and so on.

Cases begin appearing around 5th October, peak was on 6th October, after the number of cases gradually decreases. The incubation period was supposed to be around 24-72 hours. 100% of children experienced diarrhea.

This data points to the food-born poisoning outbreak. The most common symptoms being diarrhea and abdominal pain point to the Salmonella outbreak. The age at risk is 4 years while the biggest group affected are children in ‘K’ and ‘R’ kindergartens. The investigation should immediately focus on the common food source shared by given kindergartens to stop the outbreak quickly.
